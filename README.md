# Flappy-bird-deep-Q-learning
This project is a Python implementation of the game "Flappy Bird" using the Pygame library, designed to interface with a Deep Q-Network for reinforcement learning. The game mechanics include realistic bird physics, dynamic pipe generation, and collision detection for gameplay interaction.
